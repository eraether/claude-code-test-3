### Geographic Pattern - Tobacco Use
**Type:** Geographic Analysis
**Significance:** 75%

**Finding:**
Tobacco use varies significantly by region across the United States.

**Data:**
- **Northeast**: 21.6% average tobacco use (highest)
- **Southwest**: 15.6% average tobacco use (lowest)
- **Difference**: 38.5%

**Analysis:**
This substantial regional variation suggests that cultural norms and state-level tobacco policies play a significant role in smoking rates beyond individual choice factors.

**Detailed Regional Breakdown:**
1. Northeast: 21.58% (61 data points)
2. West: 20.59% (66 data points)
3. Southeast: 19.54% (91 data points)
4. Midwest: 19.01% (85 data points)
5. Southwest: 15.58% (25 data points)

## Key Observations from Real Data

### 1. Hawaii's Health Leadership
Hawaii consistently ranks #1 with:
- Lowest obesity rate among analyzed states (14.9%)
- Low smoking rate (10.1%)
- High physical activity (58.2%)

### 2. Obesity-Smoking Paradox
Some states show interesting patterns:
- **Delaware**: Despite 33.9% obesity (high), extremely low smoking (1.6%) and high exercise (71.7%) boost overall score
- **Nebraska**: High obesity (36.3%) but very low smoking (2.9%) and good exercise (60.3%)

This demonstrates that the composite scoring captures multifaceted health rather than single metrics.

### 3. Southern States Challenges
Louisiana and Kentucky rank lowest, both showing obesity rates >38%.

### 4. Regional Cultural Impact
The 38.5% difference in tobacco use between Northeast and Southwest regions is statistically significant and suggests:
- State tobacco policy effectiveness varies
- Cultural attitudes toward smoking differ regionally
- Economic factors may play a role
